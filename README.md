# Super and This in Java

The super keyword is used to refer to the immediate superclass of the current object. It helps in accessing superclass methods, fields, and constructors from a subclass.

The this keyword is used to refer to the current object within an instance method or constructor. It is useful for disambiguating variable names, calling other constructors, and returning the current class instance.
